        <p>
          I am currently enrolled in Georgia Tech's full-stack web development
          bootcamp. Prior to this, I earned an Adobe Certified Associate
          certificate, which solidified my interest in graphic design and web
          development. As a budding web developer, I'm actively seeking
          opportunities to apply my technical expertise and creative talents to
          real-world projects. My ultimate goal is to make a meaningful impact
          in the industry while advancing my career.
